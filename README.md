# Ent
Ent is a Spring Boot Authentication &amp; Authorization Platform (NIST Level 2 RBAC)

# What is RBAC?

RBAC separates the concepts of Users, Roles and Permissions. Roles are defined in a system, then Permissions defined separately. Then the security administrator decides what role should be permitted to do what action, by assigning that role to the permission. Finally users are assigned to roles. The system does the rest. 

NIST Level 2 RBAC requires Roles and/or Permissions to be hierarchical, so that management of them can easily be handled in hierarchies.
